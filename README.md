<h1>React Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h1>
<p>This project is a implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React. It offers an interactive user interface where players can compete against each other, taking turns to mark spaces on a 3x3 grid. The first player to achieve a row, column, or diagonal of their symbol (either 'X' or 'O') wins the game.</p>
